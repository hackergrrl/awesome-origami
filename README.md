# awesome origami

these are origami or paper designs that I particularly like. usually what makes
them awesome is that they use paper alone and don't require adhesives to
function

## rules

1. it's awesome because it's cool **and** there's no tape/glue/adhesive required
2. no special types of paper required
3. host instructions or video on IPFS for easy/durable storage
4. always give credit and include a license
5. bonus: include a thumbnail of what the finished result looks like
